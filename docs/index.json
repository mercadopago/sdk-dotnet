    "href": "CODING_GUIDELINES.html",
    "title": "Coding Guidelines | MercadoPago official .NET SDK",
    "keywords": "Coding Guidelines The Mercado Pago .NET is a collaborative effort from the start. The SDK team thinks that contributions from different developer will enrich it's feature set and make it more relevant to the community. However; absorbing all contributions as-is, while expedient, might lead to difficulties in maintenance of the codebase is left unchecked. Collaborative codebases often establish guidelines for contributors to ensure code remains maintainable over time. The effort to maintain the SDK is no different in this regard so a bit of guidance is in order. The purpose of this guide is to set a baseline for contributions. These guidelines are not intended to limit the tools at your disposal nor to rewire the way you think but rather to encourage good neighbor behavior. Language Guidelines We use english language. This is to be consistent everywhere, and to be considerate with developers that do not speak our native language. Therefore: source code, comments, documentation, commit messages, review comments, and any other kind of contribution MUST use english language. Typos are unavoidable, but try to reduce them by using a spellchecker. Most IDEs can be configured to run one automatically. Code Guidelines Set your IDE to follow the .editorconfig in each repository. Follow the C# Coding Convention . Generally speaking, be conscious when contributing and try following the same style that the code in the SDK already has. If you have any doubts, just ask us! This rules will be enforced automatically when making a pull requests, and checks will fail if you do not follow them, resulting in your contribution being automatically rejected until fixed. Comment Guidelines Comments in code are a hard thing to write, not because the words are difficult to produce but because it is hard to make relevant comments. Too much of it and people do not read comments (and it obfuscates code reading) and too little of it gives you no recourse but to read large portions of codebase to get insight as to what a feature/codeblock is doing. Both situations are undesirable and efforts should be made at all time to have a please comment reading experience As a general rule you would have to comment on decisions you made while coding that are not part of any specification. In particular you should always comment any decision that: Departs from common wisdom or convention (The why's are necessary). Takes a significant amount of time to produce. A good rule of thumb here is that if you spent more than 1 hour thinking on how to produce a fragment of code that took 2 minutes of wrist time to write you should document your thinking to aid reader and allow for validation. Need to preserve properties of the implementation. This is the case of performance sensitive portions of the codebase, goroutines synchronization, implementations of security primitives, congestion control algorithms, etc. As a general rule of what not to comment you should avoid: Commenting on structure of programs that is already part of a convention, specified or otherwise. Having pedantic explanations of behavior that can be found by immediate examination of the surrounding code artifacts. Commenting on behavior you cannot attest. Branching Guidelines Currently master is our only long term branch, below a few suggestions of short term branches naming: hotfix/something-needs-fix : Small routine patches in code to features already there. feature/something-new : A new feature or a change in a existent feature. Beware of breaking changes that would require a major version bump. doc/improves-documentation-for-this-feature : If you add or change documentation with no impact to the source code. Git Guidelines All commits SHOULD follow the seven rules of a great Git commit message : Separate subject from body with a blank line. Limit the subject line to 72 characters. Capitalize the subject line. Do not end the subject line with a period. Use the imperative mood in the subject line. Wrap the body at 72 characters. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how. Commits such as \"fix tests\", \"now it's working\" and many other common messages we find usually in code WON'T be accepted. Ideally we would like to enforce these rules, but we are realistic and understand that it might be a big change for some people. So unless deviating heavily from what was stated we might accept your commits even if not following these rules perfectly. Please avoid taking to much time to deliver code, and always rebase your code to avoid reverse merge commits. When reviewing, check if the PR adheres to C# Coding Convention ."

    "keywords": "Contributing to the Mercado Pago .NET Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Mercado Pago .NET! How to contribute In order to contribute to the Mercado Pago .NET effectively we provide guidelines to address common case for contributions. Presently we have guides for the following type of changes. Request For Change (RFC) / Feature Request: These are suggestions / requests for features the SDK currently does not have. The SDK team evaluates these requests for adequacy / relevance / capacity and overall architectural consistency. Bug Reports: These are reports of non compliant behavior with the SDK specification and other blatantly wrong behavior of the Mercado Pago .NET. In addition to contributing in the form of Bug Reports and RFCs it is also possible to contribute directly in code with a Pull Request (PR). In the case of a Pull Request you should also indicate the nature of the Pull Request (Feature/Bug/etc.) to help the team asses the Pull Request. If you are enthusiastic about a particular Feature being added or a bug being fixed, a PR is often the quickest way to promote your change as the team does not have to allocate as much resources to process the contribution. In the case of PRs it is often best to consult with the SDK team before embarking on a PR, specially if it's a beefy one. Spending time on a PR that might later be rejected because major discrepancies with vision or competing contributions is an uncomfortable outcome for all involved people. Remember the SDK team with privilege overall consistency and progress over any one particular contribution. Coding Guidance All contributions MUST follow the Coding Guidelines . Contributions that fail to follow this guidelines will be disregarded and told to make the required modifications to do so. Request For Change / Feature Request Generally speaking an RFC is needed when you want to add a new feature or change an existing one in an incompatible way that might result in a major version bump to the toolkit. Though it seems a little bureaucratic, the process is in place in order to avoid frustration of a potential contributor by making the discussions take place before any code is written. Once the design and direction is fully agreed then the contributor can work peacefully knowing that their change will be committed. As of this moment all you need to do is create an issue and use the Feature Request Template . Please prepend your issue title with [RFC] so that's easier to filter. Bug Reports Bugs are a reality in software. We can't fix what we don't know about, so please report liberally. If you're not sure if something is a bug or not, feel free to file it anyway. Before reporting a bug, please search existing issues and pull requests, as it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. In the off case that you find your issue as fixed/closed, please add a reference to it on your new one. Your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix. Opening an issue is as easy as following this link and filling out the given template. Bug reports may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a failing test. Pull Request First and foremost: Source code, documentation, commit messages, review comments, and any other kind of contribution must MUST follow the C# Coding Convention . We use the \"fork and pull\" model described here , where contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests to bring those changes into the source repository. Your basic steps to get going: Fork the corresponding toolkit repository and create a branch from master for the issue you are working on. Commit as you go following our git conventions. Include tests that cover all non-trivial code. The existing tests should provide a template on how to test the toolkit correctly. Make sure all test passes. All code changes are expected to comply with the formatting style. Push your commits to GitHub and create a pull request against the corresponding toolkit component master branch. If taking to much time to deliver code, always rebase towards master before asking for a review, and avoid reverse merge commits."
